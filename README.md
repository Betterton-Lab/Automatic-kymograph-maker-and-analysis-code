# Automatic Kymograph Maker and Analysis Documentation

Our codes run with MATLAB 2020 or later version. 

Four softwares we wrote for our analysis are combined here, with their function briefly summarized below: 

- Segmentation:  obtaining segmented_cell.mat from data.nd2  

- AutomaticKymographMaker:  creating single automated kymograph from each segmented_cell.mat  

- AutomaticKymographAnalyzer:   analyzing collection of kymographs, plot their average intensity profile at different spindle length

- Cut7RatioFinder:   analyzing the cut7 midzone-to-pole ratio vs. time for each cell, using segmented_cell.mat and pos_cut7_pk.mat.



## How to use each software? 

Please review README in each software's subdirectory. 


## Where to obtain our dataset for test run? 

All of our data are avaliable at  https://doi.org/10.25810/fsdf-t849
